This free InPost extension integrates WooCommerce store with the InPost system - create and generate parcels directly from your e-store.

== Description ==

InPost for WooCommerce plugin was developed for small and medium sized businesses which are looking for an easy way to integrate with InPost services.

Once installed the plugin allows the configuration of any services provided by InPost available in the target market. In Canada, InPost enables within WooCommerce e-store a new delivery method - InPost Lockers 24/7.

After installation of the plugin you need to configure the InPost Locker 24/7 delivery method and configure the pricing. In the e-store checkout, the user will be able to select InPost Lockers 24/7 as a delivery method for their order.  Additionally, the user will be able to specify the destination locker that their order will be delivered to.

After the order placement process, you will be able to manage the shipment through the administration panel. The plugin allows you to edit the data needed to create the shipment and generate an InPost label.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why InPost? =

InPost is an international network of fully automated parcel lockers that are accessible 24/7, the means no more waiting in line-ups, and empower the customer with the ability to collect, send and return parcels at their convenience. InPost's lockers are located with safety and security in mind.  You will find us at supermarkets, gas stations and at public transportation stations.

Using an InPost Parcel Locker is very easy and intuitive. An online shopper selects the InPost Parcel Lockers 24/7 at the e-shop’s check-out and chooses their preferred locker, usually a location that falls in their usual travel routes - along the way to home, school or work. Once the parcel is delivered, the customer receives an automated text message and email that includes a secure opening code. When the customer arrives at the locker they simply scan or enter the code and the parcel is ready for collection, in less than 10 seconds the customer is on their way.
